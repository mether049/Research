> - An interesting Maldoc acting as drop-and-execute was identified and spotted in the wild targeting System Integrator based in Europe . From the described analysis we attempted to identify the attacker by observing he was exploiting an old infrastructure behind 66.133.129.5 as a dropping websites.<br>
> - the researchers also pointed out that the IP addresses (i.e. 66.133.129.5) observed in the attacks were involved in previous campaigns delivering Locky and Dridex malware.
> - Since no final stage was obtained so far, attribution is quite hard, but TTPs suggest a TA-505 attacker, due to the collected artifacts and to the analyzed URLs.

> - They are also known for using remote access Trojans (RATs) and malware downloaders that delivered the Dridex and Trick banking Trojans as secondary payloads during their campaigns, as well as several ransomware strains including Locky, BitPaymer, Philadelphia, GlobeImposter, and Jaff on their targets' computers now also including Clop ransomware after the attack on UM.
> - UM also disclosed that it acquired the ransomware decryptor from the attackers by paying a 30 bitcoin ransom (roughly $220,000 or €220,000) to restore all the encrypted files as Reuters reported.

> - During our investigation of Anchor, we discovered the tool PowerRatankba that was previously linked to the purported North Korean group was, in fact, used in Anchor.
> - The specific evidence pointed out that this Lazarus group toolkit was loaded via the TrickBot Anchor project pointing to the now-unmasked relationship between the tools attributed to TrickBot “Anchor” group and Lazarus.
