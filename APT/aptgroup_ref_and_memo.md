- [TA-505 Cybercrime on System Integrator Companies](https://marcoramilli.com/2019/11/12/ta-505-cybercrime-on-system-integrator-companies/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=ReviveOldPost)
> - An interesting Maldoc acting as drop-and-execute was identified and spotted in the wild targeting System Integrator based in Europe . From the described analysis we attempted to identify the attacker by observing he was exploiting an old infrastructure behind 66.133.129.5 as a dropping websites.<br>
> - the researchers also pointed out that the IP addresses (i.e. 66.133.129.5) observed in the attacks were involved in previous campaigns delivering Locky and Dridex malware.
> - Since no final stage was obtained so far, attribution is quite hard, but TTPs suggest a TA-505 attacker, due to the collected artifacts and to the analyzed URLs.

> - During our investigation of Anchor, we discovered the tool PowerRatankba that was previously linked to the purported North Korean group was, in fact, used in Anchor.
> - The specific evidence pointed out that this Lazarus group toolkit was loaded via the TrickBot Anchor project pointing to the now-unmasked relationship between the tools attributed to TrickBot “Anchor” group and Lazarus.
