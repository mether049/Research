> #emotet Has just changed.  We see a difference in the URI structure and multipart/form-data POST's. Also noticing that the client filename doesn't appear to be generated from the old wordlist.

> - #Emotet Update: Looks like we are seeing signs of a protocol change for C2 that matches what we saw last night for the new possible E4 loader. It may not be an E4 but more likely a loader/C2 revision that is inbound. Right now only E2 is exhibiting this behavior.
> - C2 calls are now looking like IP:port\2\to\6\random\alphanumeric\directories\ and are seen by the main loader C2 and modules. Be on the lookout for big changes inbound!
