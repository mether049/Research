> #emotet Has just changed.  We see a difference in the URI structure and multipart/form-data POST's. Also noticing that the client filename doesn't appear to be generated from the old wordlist.
- [Twitter@Cryptolaemus1](https://twitter.com/Cryptolaemus1/status/1225168678876000261)
> - #Emotet Update: Looks like we are seeing signs of a protocol change for C2 that matches what we saw last night for the new possible E4 loader. It may not be an E4 but more likely a loader/C2 revision that is inbound. Right now only E2 is exhibiting this behavior.
> - C2 calls are now looking like IP:port\2\to\6\random\alphanumeric\directories\ and are seen by the main loader C2 and modules. Be on the lookout for big changes inbound!

# PlugX
### Target
**2020-02-03<br>**
- [New wave of PlugX targets Hong Kong](https://insights.oem.avira.com/new-wave-of-plugx-targets-hong-kong/)
> Avira’s Advanced Threat Research team discovered a new version of PlugX from the Mustang Panda APT that is used to spy on some targets in Hong Kong and Vietnam.
> Based on our telemetry, we found several victims from Hong Kong, Vietnam, Australia, and China but most of the victims are from Hong Kong.

### Function
**2020-02-03<br>**
- [New wave of PlugX targets Hong Kong](https://insights.oem.avira.com/new-wave-of-plugx-targets-hong-kong/)
> - the PlugX that Mustang Panda APT uses has some extra features, including spreading through USB, gathering information, and stealing documents in air-gaped networks via USB.<br>
> - After detecting the removable USB volume drive, the PlugX variant creates a hidden folder with name “RECYCLE.BIN” and copies the EXE file, the loader DLL, and encrypted DAT file. Then, it hides all of the folders in the root directory and creates LNK for each one in order to deceive the victim to click on the LNK files.
> - PlugX checks whether there’s no internet access, then tries to find the USB stick and creates the BAT file in the following path, <usb volume>\RECYCLE.BIN\<plugX clsid>\tmp.bat, and executes it. At the end, it deletes the BAT file.By running this BAT file, it gathers local and network information about the infected system and tries to send it out via USB.
> - It abuses RAR to search document files and compress them locally in order to send it to its CNC server.
> - PlugX sends an encrypted random ID to initialize the connection via raw TCP and then receives a response from server.(New communication mechanism)
