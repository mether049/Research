> #Emotet Botnets E1-E3 have not been spamming today that we can detect. It looks like either Ivan had technical issues today or this is the start of a break. If anyone has any signs of Emotet activity/spamming today. Feel free to reach out.  TT

### Function
**2020-01-23<br>**
- [New Obfuscation Techniques in Emotet Maldocs](https://security-soup.net/new-obfuscation-techniques-in-emotet-maldocs/)
> - These are techniques likely designed to bypass detection by AV engines and/or spam filters.
> - The new obfuscation included some fundamental changes to the document structure (e.g. new variants of user forms, modules, and objects) , as well as a significantly upgraded obfuscation scheme within the VBA macro code itself.

- [Twitter@CofenseLabs](https://twitter.com/CofenseLabs/status/1225168704893308934)
> #emotet Has just changed.  We see a difference in the URI structure and multipart/form-data POST's. Also noticing that the client filename doesn't appear to be generated from the old wordlist.
- [Twitter@Cryptolaemus1](https://twitter.com/Cryptolaemus1/status/1225168678876000261)
> - #Emotet Update: Looks like we are seeing signs of a protocol change for C2 that matches what we saw last night for the new possible E4 loader. It may not be an E4 but more likely a loader/C2 revision that is inbound. Right now only E2 is exhibiting this behavior.
> - C2 calls are now looking like IP:port\2\to\6\random\alphanumeric\directories\ and are seen by the main loader C2 and modules. Be on the lookout for big changes inbound!

**2020-03-06**
- [TrickBot Malware Targets Italy in Fake WHO Coronavirus Emails](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trickbot-malware-targets-italy-in-fake-who-coronavirus-emails/)
> - A new spam campaign is underway that is preying on the fears of Coronavirus (COVID-19) to target people in Italy with the TrickBot information-stealing malware.
> - These emails have a subject of "Coronavirus: Informazioni importanti su precauzioni" and pretends to be information about the necessary precautions people in Italy should take to protect themselves from the Coronavirus.

- [TrickBot Now Uses a Windows 10 UAC Bypass to Evade Detection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trickbot-now-uses-a-windows-10-uac-bypass-to-evade-detection/)
> - If it is Windows 7, TrickBot will utilize the CMSTPLUA UAC bypass and if Windows 10, will now use the Fodhelper UAC Bypass.<br>
> - TrickBot utilizes this bypass to launch itself without a warning to the user and thus evading detection by the user.<br>

> - This week, ReaQta discovered that TrickBot has now switched to a different UAC bypass that utilizes the Wsreset.exe program.
> - When executed, Wsreset.exe will read a command from the default value of the HKCU\Software\Classes\AppX82a6gwre4fdg3bt635tn5ctqjf8msdd2\Shell\open\command key and execute it.

**2020-03-09**
- [New Variant of TrickBot Being Spread by Word Document](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/new-variant-of-trickbot-being-spread-by-word-document.html)
> - FortiGuard Labs captured an MS Office Word sample in the wild that is spreading a new variant of TrickBot. 
> - The Macro project is password-protected, so we cannot see any of the detailed information until we provide the correct password. Fortunately, there is a way to bypass this protection by modifying its binary file. 
> - The VBA code then extracts two files onto the victim’s system. 
> - One file is “C:\AprilReport\LogsTsg\LogsTsg7\LogsTsg8\List1.bat”,with content “cscript //nologo C:\AprilReport\List1.jse”, and the other is “C:\AprilReport\List1.jse”, with JavaScript code which is a huge obfuscated JavaScript code.
> - When the code starts, it first waits around one minute to bypass any auto-analysis tools by seeming to be inert.(js)
> - After waiting, it then executes the command "Select * from Win32_Process" to obtain all running processes.  It then puts all of the names of these obtained processes together and checks to see if its length is less than 3100. If so, it will raise an exception and close. 
> - In this measure, it is better able to bypass many auto-analysis systems, including Sandboxes and Virtual Machines.
> - The JavaScript code then downloads a file from its sever. 
> - The parameter portion contains the victim’s computer name, login username, IP address, and network card information. The server then replies to this request with a base64 encoded PE file. 
> - The JavaScript code saves this file into the system’s %temp% folder
> - it copies the JavaScript file into the Windows startup folder so it can start whenever Windows OS starts. 
> - The downloaded payload file “8a1e7a8988168816.com” is a DLL file that is executed in rundll32.exe, which is a Windows-default program used to run a DLL file as a program, using the command line "C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe C:\Users\{user name}\AppData\Local\Temp\8a1e7a8988168816.com InitLibrary".

# Ursnif
### Target
**2020-02-11**
- [Malpsam pushes Ursnif through Italian language Word docs](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/25792)
> - For the past two weeks or so, I haven't found any malspam using password-protected zip archives with Word documents having macros for Ursnif.  However, on Tuesday 2020-02-11, malspam from this campaign has resumed.  This time, it used Italian language Word documents with macros for Ursnif. <br>
> - Several of these zip archives used 111 as the password.  One of them used 222 as the password.  The example I used for an infection had 333 as the password.

# PlugX
### Target
**2020-02-03<br>**
- [New wave of PlugX targets Hong Kong](https://insights.oem.avira.com/new-wave-of-plugx-targets-hong-kong/)
> Avira’s Advanced Threat Research team discovered a new version of PlugX from the Mustang Panda APT that is used to spy on some targets in Hong Kong and Vietnam.
> Based on our telemetry, we found several victims from Hong Kong, Vietnam, Australia, and China but most of the victims are from Hong Kong.

### Function
**2020-02-03<br>**
- [New wave of PlugX targets Hong Kong](https://insights.oem.avira.com/new-wave-of-plugx-targets-hong-kong/)
> - the PlugX that Mustang Panda APT uses has some extra features, including spreading through USB, gathering information, and stealing documents in air-gaped networks via USB.<br>
> - After detecting the removable USB volume drive, the PlugX variant creates a hidden folder with name “RECYCLE.BIN” and copies the EXE file, the loader DLL, and encrypted DAT file. Then, it hides all of the folders in the root directory and creates LNK for each one in order to deceive the victim to click on the LNK files.
> - PlugX checks whether there’s no internet access, then tries to find the USB stick and creates the BAT file in the following path, <usb volume>\RECYCLE.BIN\<plugX clsid>\tmp.bat, and executes it. At the end, it deletes the BAT file.By running this BAT file, it gathers local and network information about the infected system and tries to send it out via USB.
> - It abuses RAR to search document files and compress them locally in order to send it to its CNC server.
> - PlugX sends an encrypted random ID to initialize the connection via raw TCP and then receives a response from server.(New communication mechanism)

```
> - If a file matches one of the above extensions, the stealer will check the contents of the file and see if they contain one of the 85 keywords
> - In addition, the stealer will check if the filename contains any of the following 55 keywords
> - When a matching document is found, the malware will upload it to an FTP site that is under the attacker's control. 
> - Some of the new search words that were added since the latest version include 'treason', 'NATO', 'convict', 'traitor', 'embeddedspy', 'cyber', 'submarine', 'Submarinesecret', 'contraband', 'radio', 'suspect', 'operation', and 'bribery.'

- [New Nemty Ransomware May Spread via Compromised RDP Connections](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-nemty-ransomware-may-spread-via-compromised-rdp-connections/)
> - Like any proper file-encrypting malware, Nemty will delete the shadow copies for the files it processes, taking away from the victim the possibility to recover versions of the data as created by the Windows operating system.
> - it comes with an unusual name for the mutex object. The author called it "hate,"
> - Another interesting thing is a verification Nemty makes to identify computers in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Ukraine.
> - leveraging a RDP connection puts the attacker in control as they no longer have to wait for the victim to take the phishing bait.

> - The Nemty Ransomware has outlined plans to create a blog that will be used to publish stolen data for ransomware victims who refuse to pay the ransom.
> - A new tactic started by the Maze Ransomware and now used by Sodinokibi ​​​​​​is to steal files from companies before encrypting them. If a victim does not pay the ransom, then the stolen data will be leaked little-by-little until payment has been made or it has all been released.

**2020-02-27**
- [Nemty Ransomware Actively Distributed via 'Love Letter' Spam](bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/nemty-ransomware-actively-distributed-via-love-letter-spam/)

> - What sets this campaign apart from others is that the operators didn't bother composing an enticing email since all these spam messages only contain a wink ;) text emoticon.
> - "Attached to each email is a ZIP archive with a name formatted as 'LOVE_YOU_######_2020.zip' with only the #s changing," researchers at X-Force IRIS found.
